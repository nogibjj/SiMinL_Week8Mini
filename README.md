# Requirements 
- Take an existing Python script for data processing
- Rewrite it in Rust
- Highlight improvements in speed and resource usage

# Program
This repository contains Rust and Python implementations for approximating definite integrals of functions with the Trapezoidal Rule numerical method. Basic structure including CI/CD, Testing, Makefile and reproducible environments are included.
Time taken for Python and Rust programs are recorded.

# Results
